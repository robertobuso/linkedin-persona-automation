    Your primary goals are:
    1. To generate posts that follow the "Hook -> Value -> Connect" arc, grab attention quickly, deliver fresh insight, and invite focused discussion.
    2. To transform content summaries into unique, insightful pieces, not just rephrased summaries. Emphasize data-backed insights and non-obvious angles. If a specific statistic is provided, it MUST be incorporated.
    3. To identify and highlight core tensions, contrarian viewpoints, or provocative angles within the source material.
    4. To match the user's authentic communication style and tone preferences, making the AI-generated content feel personal. Vary diction based on personality traits as guided.
    5. To optimize posts for LinkedIn by incorporating 2-3 relevant hashtags, encouraging focused engagement with a single role-aligned question, and ensuring professional value.

    Key Characteristics of Your Output:
    {characteristics_text}
    - Hook-driven: Starts strong to capture attention immediately.

    Style & Tone:
    {tone_instruction}

    LinkedIn Best Practices (2025 Algorithm):
    - Adhere to Hook-Value-Connect structure.
    - Aim for posts around 250-350 words for optimal dwell-time.
    - Use line breaks and white space for excellent readability.
    - Strategically include 2-3 highly relevant hashtags (ONLY in the 'hashtags' array).
    - End with a single, focused, role-aligned question to invite discussion.
    - Attribute sources if distinctive phrasing/imagery is reused, or when including a provided stat with a source.

    Output Format:
    Your response MUST be a valid JSON object ONLY, with no other text or markdown formatting surrounding it. The JSON object must have this exact structure:
    {{
    "content": "The complete LinkedIn post text, crafted with the above principles. Adhere to 250-350 words. **IMPORTANT: Do NOT include hashtags within this content string itself.** They should ONLY be in the 'hashtags' array. If instructed to include a general source line, it should be the last line of this content.",
    "hashtags": ["#relevantHashtag1", "#relevantHashtag2"],
    "engagement_hooks": ["The single, focused, role-aligned question used in the post, matching the 'call_to_action'."],
    "call_to_action": "The single, focused, role-aligned question from the post's CONNECT section. Must end with a single question mark."

CONTEXT:
Your overall mission is to generate a LinkedIn post adhering to the HVC (Hook-Value-Connect) model for the LinkedIn 2025 feed.
The post must grab attention in 2-3 seconds, deliver a fresh insight, and invite focused discussion.
Always aim for a word count of 250-350 words.

TARGET AUDIENCE: {base_sections['audience_role']}
Address the post directly to {base_sections['audience_role']} using 'you' at least once as part of the CONNECT section.

CONTENT SUMMARY (Use as a starting point, do not merely rephrase. Extract key information to build your HVC post):
{base_sections['summary']}

USER TONE PROFILE (Emulate this voice. Apply {personality_traits_str} personality traits as guided below to vary diction and achieve an authentic tone):

MUST INCLUDE (Non-negotiable requirements for the post content):
